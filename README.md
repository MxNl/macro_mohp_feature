The EU-MOHP dataset was developed and generated as part of the [MACRO
project](https://www.bgr.bund.de/EN/Themen/Wasser/Projekte/laufend/F+E/Macro/macro_projektbeschr_en.html?nn=1548270).

This repository contains the required code to generate the EU-MOHP
v013.1.0 dataset. For further reading and more background information,
we refer to the corresponding publication of the !!datadescriptorlink.
The dataset can be freely downloaded at !!link.

A static code repository with the version used for generating the
dataset can be found !!here
