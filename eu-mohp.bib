	abstract = {While the application of neural networks for groundwater level forecasting in general has been investigated by many authors, the use of nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX) is relatively new. For this work NARX were applied to obtain groundwater level forecasts for several wells in southwest Germany. Wells in porous, fractured and karst aquifers were investigated and forecasts of lead times up to half a year were conducted for both inﬂuenced (e.g. nearby pumping) and uninﬂuenced wells. Precipitation and temperature were chosen as predictors, which makes the selected approach easily transferable, since both parameters are widely available and simple to measure. Input and feedback delays were determined by applying STL time series decomposition on the data and using autoand cross-correlation functions on the remainders to determine signiﬁcant time lags. Coefﬁcient of determination, (relative) root mean squared error and Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency were used to evaluate forecasts, the model selection was based on an out-of-sample validation on rolling basis. The results are promising and indicate an outstanding suitability of NARX for groundwater level predictions with such a small set of inputs in all three aquifer types.},

	abstract = {Sustainable management of groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions require an application of reliable and accurate predictions of groundwater levels. Mechanistic multi-scale, multi-physics simulation models are often too hard to use for this purpose, especially for groundwater managers who do not have access to the complex compute resources and data. Therefore, we analyzed the applicability and performance of four modern deep learning computational models for predictions of groundwater levels. We compare three methods for optimizing the models’ hyperparameters, including two surrogate model-based algorithms and a random sampling method. The models were tested using predictions of the groundwater level in Butte County, California, USA, taking into account the temporal variability of streamﬂow, precipitation, and ambient temperature. Our numerical study shows that the optimization of the hyperparameters can lead to reasonably accurate performance of all models, but the “simplest” network, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs overall better for learning and predicting groundwater data than the more advanced long short-term memory or convolutional neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy and time-to-solution, making the MLP a suitable candidate for groundwater prediction.},

	abstract = {Reducing nitrogen inputs, in particular nitrate, to groundwater is becoming increasingly important to fulﬁl requirements of the European Water Framework Directive. When developing management plans for mitigation measures at larger scales, complex hydro-biogeochemical models reach their limits due to data availability and spatial discretization. To circumvent this problem, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater is estimated using a parsimonious GIS-based statistical approach. Point nitrate concentrations and spatial environmental data as predictors are used to train statistical models. In order to compile the spatial predictors with the respective monitoring sites, different designs of contributing areas (buffer zones) and their effects on the performance of different statistical models are investigated. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) are compared in terms of the predictive performance of each model according to various objective functions. We determine the most inﬂuential spatial predictors used in the respective models. After training the models with a subset of the data, we then predict the spatial nitrate distribution in groundwater for the entire federal state of Hesse, Germany on a 1 × 1 km grid by only the spatial environmental data. The Random Forest model outperforms the other models (R2 = 0.54), relying on hydrogeological units, the percentage of arable land and the nitrogen balance as the three most inﬂuencing predictors based on a 1000 m circular contributing area. The use of exclusively spatial available predictors is a big step forward in the prediction of nitrate in groundwater on regional scale.},

	abstract = {The location of a point on the landscape within a stream network (hydrologic position) can be an important predictive measure in hydrology. Hydrologic position is deﬁned here by two metrics: lateral position and distance from stream to divide, both measured horizontally. Lateral position (dimensionless) is the relative position of a point between the stream and its watershed divide. Distance from stream to divide (units of length) is an indicator of position within a watershed: generally small near a conﬂuence and generally large in headwater areas. Watersheds and watershed divides are deﬁned here by Thiessen polygons rather than topographic divides. Lateral position and distance from stream to divide are also deﬁned in the context of hydrologic order. Hydrologic order “n” is deﬁned as the network of streams, and associated divides, of order n and higher. And given that a point can have different positions in different hydrologic orders the term multiorder hydrologic position (MOHP) is used to describe the ensemble of hydrologic positions. MOHP was mapped across the conterminous United States for nine hydrologic orders at a spatial resolution of 30 m (about 8.7 billion pixels). There are 18 metrics for each pixel. Four case studies are presented that use MOHP metrics as explanatory factors in random forest machine learning models. The case studies show that lower order MOHP metrics can serve as indicators of hydrologic process while higher‐order metrics serve as indicators of location. MOHP is shown to have utility as a predictor variable across a large range of scales (50,000 to 8,000,000 km2).},

	abstract = {Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are typically the main focus of nutrient management strategies; however, some studies have found that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) can be the dominant form of total nitrogen (TN) in several Australian estuaries and catchments. To better understand nitrogen cycling and explore the relationships between measured groundwater DON and environmental factors, thirteen machine learning (ML) techniques were compared in this study. DON was simulated under two scenarios using a range of input variables: 1) detailed nutrient data with landscape and sampling factors, and 2) limited nutrient data with landscape and sampling factors. Most of the tested ML algorithms more accurately predicted DON than when it was estimated from the difference between TN and DIN. Some models show greater adaptability to different modelling conditions, with only a few approaches able to predict with high accuracy using limited input variables (scenario 2). From the models tested, bagged mars, cubist and random forest were selected as optimal. Sample depth, sampling date and specific surface water area were the important non-nutrient input variables for DON prediction, which reveals the significant effect of surface environmental factors and seasonality on groundwater DON.},

	abstract = {It is now well established to use shallow artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) to obtain accurate and reliable groundwater level forecasts, which are an important tool for sustainable groundwater management. However, we observe an increasing shift from conventional shallow ANNs to state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) techniques, but a direct comparison of the performance is often lacking. Although they have already clearly proven their suitability, especially shallow recurrent networks 5 frequently seem to be excluded from the study design despite the euphoria about new DL techniques and its successes in various disciplines. Therefore, we aim to provide an overview on the predictive ability in terms of groundwater levels of shallow conventional recurrent ANN namely nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX), and popular state-ofthe-art DL-techniques such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We compare both the performance on sequence-to-value (seq2val) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) forecasting on a 4-year period, while 10 using only few, widely available and easy to measure meteorological input parameters, which makes our approach widely applicable. We observe that for seq2val forecasts NARX models on average perform best, however, CNNs are much faster and only slightly worse in terms of accuracy. For seq2seq forecasts, mostly NARX outperform both DL-models and even almost reach the speed of CNNs. However, NARX are the least robust against initialization effects, which nevertheless can be handled easily using ensemble forecasting. We showed that shallow neural networks, such as NARX, should not be neglected in 15 comparison to DL-techniques; however, LSTMs and CNNs might perform substantially better with a larger data set, where DL really can demonstrate its strengths, which is rarely available in the groundwater domain though.},

This comprehensive review considers the research progress in the past two decades, the current state-of-the-art, and future prospects of the application of neurocomputing to diﬀerent aspects of hydrological sciences, i.e., quantitative surface hydrology and hydraulics. An extensive literature survey, by running over more than 800 peer-reviewed papers, outlines and concisely explores the past and recent tendencies in the application of conventional neural-based approaches and modern neurocomputing models in relevant topics of hydrological and hydraulic sciences. Apart from segregated descriptions and analyses of the main facets of surface hydrology and hydraulics, this review oﬀers a practical summary of prevailing neurocomputing methods used in diﬀerent subﬁelds of hydrology and water engineering. Six relevant topics to modelling hydrological and hydraulic sciences are articulated and analysed, including modelling of water level in surface water bodies, ﬂood and risk assessment, sediment transport in river systems, urban water demand prediction, modelling ﬂow through hydro-structures, and hydraulics of sewers. This review is meant to be a mainstream guideline for researchers and practitioners whose work is associated with data mining and machine learning methods in various areas of water engineering and hydrological sciences to assist them to decide on suitable methods, network structures and modelling strategies for a given problem.},

Concentrations of one or more GCOCs in 168 (67\%) wells exceeded MCLs (maximum contaminant levels), SMCLs (secondary MCLs), or HBSLs (health-based screening levels). Human-health benchmark thresholds (MCLs or HBSLs) were exceeded in 31 (12\%) wells, and included 0.8\% for fluoride (F), 2.4\% for arsenic (As), 4\% for lead-210 (210Pb), and 6.7\% for polonium-210 (210Po). Values of pH increase with age and were outside the SMCL in 31\% of wells (23\% {\textless} 6.5 and 7.5\% {\textgreater} 8.5, SMCL). Among GCOCs with concentrations that increased significantly with groundwater age, the frequency of sentry threshold exceedances (i.e., one-half of MCL, SMCL, or HBSL) included 40\% for dissolved solids (DS), 12\% for chloride (Cl), 3.6\% for F, 4.4\% for As, and 9.5\% for 210Po. Iron (Fe) concentrations did not correlate with groundwater age, but exceeded sentry thresholds in 29\% of wells. Groundwater age, water types, redox, pH, and GCOCs varied because of unique hydrogeologic features of the aquifers (recharge locations and geometry). As expected, primarily confined aquifers had young, oxic, low to near-neutral pH water near the outcrop (recharge area), and older, reduced, high pH water deeper and farther along flow paths. However, unique aquifer hydrogeologic conditions, such as multiple-recharge zones produced anomalous patterns of young and old groundwater at varying depths and locations along flow paths. Evidence for this variability is seen in disequilibrium patterns in the progression of the chemical evolution of groundwater with hydrologic position. When hydrogeologic differences are considered, groundwater age combined with hydrologic-position data, can provide a strong basis for inferring potential occurrence of GCOCs.},

Machine learning was used to create spatially continuous and three-dimensional predictions of salinity across drinking-water aquifers in the embayment. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models, a type of machine learning, were used to predict speciﬁc conductance (SC) and chloride (Cl), and total dissolved solids (TDS) was calculated from a correlation with SC. Explanatory variables for BRT models included well location and construction, surﬁcial variables (e.g., soils and land use), and variables extracted from a groundwater-ﬂow model, including simulated groundwater ages. BRT model ﬁts (r2) were 0.74 (SC and Cl) and 0.62 (TDS). BRT models provided spatially continuous salinity predictions across surﬁcial and deeper aquifers where discrete water-quality samples were missing. Uncertainty was smaller where salinity was lower, and models tended to underpredict in areas of highest salinity. Despite this, BRT models were able to capture areas of documented high salinity that exceed the TDS secondary maximum contaminant level for drinking water of 500 mg/L. Variables that served as surrogates for position along groundwater ﬂowpaths were the most important predictors, indicating that much of the control on dissolved solids is related to rock-water interaction as residence time increases. BRT models additionally support hypotheses of both surﬁcial and deep sources of salinity.},

	abstract = {A boosted regression tree model was developed to predict pH conditions in three dimensions throughout the glacial aquifer system of the contiguous United States using pH measurements in samples from 18,386 wells and predictor variables that represent aspects of the hydrogeologic setting. Model results indicate that the carbonate content of soils and aquifer materials strongly controls pH and, when coupled with long ﬂowpaths, results in the most alkaline conditions. Conversely, in areas where glacial sediments are thin and carbonate-poor, pH conditions remain acidic. At depths typical of drinking-water supplies, predicted pH {\textgreater}7.5—which is associated with arsenic mobilization—occurs more frequently than predicted pH {\textless}6—which is associated with water corrosivity and the mobilization of other trace elements. A novel aspect of this model was the inclusion of numerically based estimates of groundwater ﬂow characteristics (age and ﬂowpath length) as predictor variables. The sensitivity of pH predictions to these variables was consistent with hydrologic understanding of groundwater ﬂow systems and the geochemical evolution of groundwater quality. The model was not developed to provide precise estimates of pH at any given location. Rather, it can be used to more generally identify areas where contaminants may be mobilized into groundwater and where corrosivity issues may be of concern to prioritize areas for future groundwater monitoring.},

The volume, variety, and velocity of water-related data are increasing due to large-scale sensor networks and increased attention to topics such as disaster response, water resources management, and climate change. Combined with the growing availability of computational resources and popularity of deep learning, these data are transformed into actionable and practical knowledge, revolutionizing the water industry. In this article, a systematic review of literature is conducted to identify existing research which incorporates deep learning methods in the water sector, with regard to monitoring, management, governance and communication of water resources. The study provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches used in the water industry for generation, prediction, enhancement, and classification tasks, and serves as a guide for how to utilize available deep learning methods for future water resources challenges.},
