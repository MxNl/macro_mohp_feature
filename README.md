The EU-MOHP dataset was developed and generated as part of the [MACRO
project](https://www.bgr.bund.de/EN/Themen/Wasser/Projekte/laufend/F+E/Macro/macro_projektbeschr_en.html?nn=1548270).

This repository contains the required code to generate the EU-MOHP
v013.1.0 dataset. For further reading, we refer to the publication of
the !!datadescriptorlink. The dataset can be freely downloaded at !!link

# Spatial Coverage

A figure of the spatial coverage is included in corresponding data
